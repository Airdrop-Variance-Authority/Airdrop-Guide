## Multi Accounting Guide for Airdrop Farming

Want to maximize your airdrop profits 10x? The key is to use multiple wallets, but be cautious of getting flagged as a sybil account in the process.

Let's dive into the steps üíé

### Tools You Need to Master Multi Accounting

#### 1. **Anti-Detect Browser**

Anti-detect browsers are essential for hiding your IP and creating multiple unique Chrome profiles with different internet fingerprints. This is crucial for airdrop hunting. I recommend these options:

üèÜ **[AdsPower](https://share.adspower.net/hB6jUirJmUdofWz) - 50% discount**

ü•à **[Dolphin](https://dolphin-anty.com/)** 

- **AdsPower**: More secure and user-friendly. With a $116/year subscription, you can create up to 50 browser profiles. Monthly plans are available for $19, but I suggest going for the yearly subscription if you're planning to scale.
- **Dolphin Browser**: Free for the first 10 profiles, but costs $10 for each additional 10 wallets. It‚Äôs less secure but a cheaper option for getting started.

In general, **AdsPower** is more trusted by the community, especially if you need more than 10 wallets.

#### 2. **Proxies/VPN for 3+ Wallets**

If you're using more than 3 wallets, it's a good idea to use proxies or VPNs to avoid linking your wallets. This is particularly important for websites like Twitter, Discord, and platforms like Galxe, Layer3, and Intract. For the majority of airdrops, however, they rely more on on-chain data rather than IP addresses.

You can purchase proxies at **[Proxyline](https://proxyline.net?ref=268356)**. The best option is the **Individual IPV4 Proxies**.

- **10 proxies** will cost you $17.7/month.
- Use **1 proxy** for a maximum of **2 accounts** to ensure anonymity.

Once you buy your proxies, set them up in your anti-detect browser.

### How to Set Up Your Anti-Detect Browser

#### Setup Process:

1. **Create a New Profile**: 
   - For **Dolphin**, click on the ‚Äú+‚Äù button.
   - For **AdsPower**, select "New Profile ‚Üí Advanced".

2. **Import Proxies**: 
   - Adjust the timezone to match the country of the proxy.

3. **Set Up Other Settings**:
   - Choose the "noise" option (if available) to add randomization.
   - Save your settings.

This gives you a fresh "Chrome Browser" profile for your airdrop hunting. Don‚Äôt forget to install necessary extensions, like MetaMask!

### How to Manage Multiple Wallets Without Getting Flagged

Let's say you want to farm airdrops using 10 wallets. Here are the 4 main rules you need to follow to avoid being flagged as a sybil account:

#### 1. **Don‚Äôt Interact with Your Other Wallets**

One of the most common mistakes new users make is transferring funds between wallets. Avoid sending or receiving funds from your other wallets, even if they're on the same device.

If you have **fewer than 5 wallets**, you are generally safe. But for **10+ wallets**, this rule is crucial.

#### 2. **Avoid Sending Funds to a Single CEX Deposit Address from Multiple Wallets**

This is one of the most obvious signs of sybil activity. Never send funds to the same deposit address on platforms like Binance, OKX, etc.

#### 3. **Use Sub Accounts on CEXs to Transfer Funds**

The best way to transfer funds between your wallets is using **sub deposit accounts** on centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance or OKX.

#### 4. **Vary Transaction Patterns**

Don't make identical transactions across all your wallets. This includes the volume of transactions, timing, and addresses. Try to avoid performing the same actions on multiple wallets at the same time.

---

### How to Use CEX Sub Accounts for Transfers

#### OKX:

1. **Deposit Funds**:
   - Open OKX and click on ‚ÄúDeposit Funds.‚Äù
   - Select the crypto and network.
   - You‚Äôll be given a deposit address. Click on ‚ÄúDeposit Addresses‚Äù and select one of the available addresses to associate with your wallet.

2. **Withdrawal**:
   - You can withdraw funds from a CEX hot wallet. No special addresses are needed.

#### Binance:

1. **Deposit Funds**:
   - Open Binance and click on ‚ÄúDeposit Funds.‚Äù
   - Select the crypto and network.
   - You‚Äôll be given a deposit address. Add a new deposit address and associate it with your wallets accordingly.

2. **Withdrawal**:
   - Withdraw funds from the CEX hot wallet as usual.

### Tips for Avoiding Sybil Flags

1. **Avoid Identical Transaction Patterns**:
   - Don‚Äôt make the same transactions with the same volume at the same time. For example, sending the same amount of crypto to multiple wallets within minutes of each other could get flagged.
   
2. **Keep Up Activity**:
   - Ensure your wallets are active at least once every two weeks.

3. **Spread Out Funding**:
   - Don‚Äôt fund all your wallets at once. Avoid funding multiple wallets on the same day.

4. **Vary Transaction Days**:
   - Don‚Äôt make transactions on all your wallets on the same day. If you do everything on one day (e.g., September 10), and then repeat on October 10, the pattern might appear suspicious.

By following these tips, you can manage multiple wallets effectively while minimizing the risk of being flagged for sybil behavior.

Good luck, and happy airdrop hunting!
